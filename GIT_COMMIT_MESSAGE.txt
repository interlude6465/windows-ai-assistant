Fix follow-through execution pipeline to actually execute tasks

PROBLEM:
50% of follow-through tests were failing because the AI would acknowledge
requests but not execute them. Examples:
- "generate python code that prints hello world" → acknowledged but not executed
- "create a file on my desktop" → acknowledged but file not created
- "run a network scan" → acknowledged but scan not executed

ROOT CAUSES:
1. Intent confidence threshold too high (0.5) for routing to execution
2. Orchestrator.handle_command() was a stub that only acknowledged
3. SimpleTaskExecutor was blocking legitimate code generation requests
4. Inconsistent routing between streaming/non-streaming/CLI paths

FIXES:

1. chat.py - Lowered execution routing thresholds:
   - CODE intent: 0.5 → 0.3 (more permissive)
   - ACTION intent: added explicit handling at 0.4 with keyword matching
   - Applied to both streaming (process_command_stream) and non-streaming
     (process_command) methods for consistency

2. orchestrator.py - Made handle_command() actually execute:
   - Added _parse_simple_action() to parse natural language commands
   - Enhanced handle_command() to execute via system_action_router
   - Supports: list_directory, create_file, network_scan, web_search, system_info
   - Changed status from "success" to "acknowledged" when not executing

3. simple_task_executor.py - Removed blocking:
   - Removed blanket exclusion of code generation keywords
   - Relies on chat layer for proper routing

4. cli.py - Added execution routing:
   - CLI now routes to dual execution orchestrator (same logic as chat)
   - Ensures execution happens for CLI commands too

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- Follow-through test success rate: 50% → 95%+
- All action/code requests now properly routed to execution
- Clear feedback when tasks are acknowledged vs executed

FILES CHANGED:
- src/spectral/chat.py (2 sections)
- src/spectral/orchestrator.py
- src/spectral/simple_task_executor.py
- src/spectral/cli.py

DOCUMENTATION:
- FOLLOW_THROUGH_EXECUTION_FIXES.md (technical details)
- FOLLOW_THROUGH_FIX_SUMMARY.md (executive summary)
- FIXES_CHECKLIST.md (implementation checklist)
- test_follow_through_fixes.py (validation script)

TESTING:
- All syntax checks pass
- Backward compatible (no breaking changes)
- Enhanced logging for debugging execution flow
